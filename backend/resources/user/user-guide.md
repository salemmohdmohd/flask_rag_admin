**You**: "How do I set up authentication?"
**AI**: "Here's how to configure user authentication..."

**You**: "What about two-factor auth?"
**AI**: "For two-factor authentication with the system I just described..."

The AI understands "the system" refers to the authentication setup from your previous question.

### Smart Suggestions

The system learns from your queries and suggests:
- **Related Topics**: Questions others have asked about similar topics
- **Next Steps**: Logical follow-up actions based on your current query
- **Deep Dives**: More detailed questions about specific aspects

- Check if documents are fully indexed (üü¢ status)

#### "Response seems incomplete"
**Cause**: The AI might not have found all relevant information.

**Solutions**:
- Ask follow-up questions for more details
- Rephrase your query to be more specific
- Check if related documents exist in the knowledge base

#### "Page loading slowly"
**Cause**: Heavy processing or high system usage.

**Solutions**:
- Refresh the page and try again
- Check your internet connection
- Contact administrator if issue persists

#### "Cannot access certain features"
**Cause**: User permissions may be limited.

**Solutions**:
- Check with your administrator about your user role
- Verify you're logged in properly
- Some features may require higher access levels

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Queries

#### Be Specific but Natural
```
Good: "How do I configure CORS headers for API endpoints?"
Better: "Show me the CORS configuration for allowing frontend access to our REST API"
```

#### Use Context from Previous Messages
```
First: "What authentication methods do we support?"
Follow-up: "How do I implement JWT authentication from the methods you mentioned?"
```

#### Ask for Examples
```
"Show me a code example for connecting to the database"
"Give me a step-by-step guide for user registration"
```

### Organizing Your Work

#### Session Naming Strategy
- Use descriptive names: "API Integration Setup"
- Include dates for time-sensitive topics: "Q4 2025 Security Review"
- Tag by project: "Project Phoenix - Authentication"

#### Conversation Flow
1. Start with broad questions to understand the topic
2. Drill down into specific implementation details
3. Ask for examples and code snippets
4. Clarify edge cases and troubleshooting steps

### Privacy and Security

#### Information Sensitivity
- The system only accesses your company's knowledge base
- Conversations are logged for quality improvement
- No personal information is shared outside your organization

#### Data Retention
- Chat history is retained for 90 days by default
- You can delete individual conversations anytime
- Exported conversations are your responsibility to secure
