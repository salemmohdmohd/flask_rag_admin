### Access Control Policies

**Password Requirements**:
- Minimum 12 characters
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- No dictionary words or personal information
- Password history: Cannot reuse last 12 passwords
- Maximum password age: 90 days

**Privileged Access Management**:
- Administrative accounts require separate credentials

### Data Protection & Privacy

**Personal Data Handling (GDPR/CCPA Compliance)**:
- Data minimization: Collect only necessary information
- Purpose limitation: Use data only for stated purposes
- Storage limitation: Retain data only as long as necessary
- Right to erasure: Provide data deletion upon request

**Data Encryption Standards**:
- Data at rest: AES-256 encryption

- Database encryption: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
- Backup encryption: AES-256 with separate key management

**Data Classification**:
1. **Public**: No protection required
2. **Internal**: Basic access controls
3. **Confidential**: Strong access controls, encryption
4. **Restricted**: Highest protection, audit logging
